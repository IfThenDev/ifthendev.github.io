How many times have you had to type in a book name to find out what level it is, or how many points the book is worth while holding the book in your hand?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With BookScanner App, you can quickly and easily scan the barcode off the back of the book to find the critical information you need to know. Your scanned books will save to a history list for easy reference later on. BookScanner will find the quiz number, ATOS (also ZPD) or Lexile level, points, word count, interest level, and via an in-app-purchase Lexile information as well. Your history can be referenced from within the app, or you can email, print, or share PDF and CSV files of your scanned book list as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a Universal App with custom screens for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad devices to fit the specific screen size &#8211; including support for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 8, iPhone 8Plus, and iPhone SE screen sizes. iPad devices also have support for landscape mode and split view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feedback from parents, school teachers, and librarians is that this app is a MUST have!<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<a href=https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/bookscanner-app\/id583672052><div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/AppStore.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-57\" width=\"125\" height=\"42\"\/><\/div><\/a>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"grid-template-columns:26% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"473\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Bookshelf Scanner Primary Screen\" class=\"wp-image-42\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-473x1024.jpg 473w, https:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-768x1662.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-710x1536.jpg 710w, https:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-946x2048.jpg 946w, https:\/\/ifthendev.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/BookshelfScanner-Image1-scaled.jpg 1183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2>Bookshelf Scanner<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every bookshelf needs a little organization. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookshelf Scanner allows you to quickly scan a book&#8217;s barcode to add it to your virtual card catalog.
